Moreover, we revealed the relationship between <i>APOE</i> variants and A&#x3b2; and tau pathologies.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS">The frequency of the &#x3b5;4 allele was not different between patients with Kii ALS/PDC and control participants. <i>APOE</i> &#x3b5;4 was associated with increased A&#x3b2; pathology (<i>p</i> = 0.005 by the <i>&#x3c7;</i> <sup>2</sup> test), but not with increased tau pathology (<i>p</i> = 0.984). The frequency of the &#x3b5;2 allele was apparently higher than that of control participants (<i>p</i> = 0.254). The <i>APOE</i> &#x3b5;2 allele was associated with increased tau pathology (<i>p</i> = 0.009) and not with reduced A&#x3b2; pathology (<i>p</i> = 0.383) in patients with Kii ALS/PDC.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="DISCUSSION">Although there was no overrepresentation of the frequency of the &#x3b5;4 or &#x3b5;2 allele, our findings suggest that the &#x3b5;2 allele is associated with increased tau pathology and not with reduced A&#x3b2; pathology in patients with Kii ALS/PDC.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#xa9; 2022 American Academy of Neurology.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Sasaki</LastName><ForeName>Ryogen</ForeName><Initials>R</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>From the School of Nursing (R.S.), Suzuka University of Medical Science;
