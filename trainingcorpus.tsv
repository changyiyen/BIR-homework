To	examine	the	association	between	appendicitis	and	the	risk	of	systemic	lupus	erythematosus	SLE
Infections	are	a	major	cause	of	morbidity	and	mortality	in	systemic	lupus	erythematosus	SLE	We	assessed	the	incidence	and	risk	factors	for	major	infections	in	SLE	in	India
Despite	how	difficult	the	early	diagnosis	of	systemic	lupus	erythematosus	SLE	is	which	is	mainly	due	to	the	heterogeneity	and	non-specificity	of	its	clinical	manifestations	SLE	is	currently	being	diagnosed	more	frequently	than	in	past	decades	In	fact	there	has	been	an	increase	in	the	incidence	and	prevalence	of	SLE	over	the	last	four	decades	this	can	be	explained	by	a	number	of	reasons	including	a	better	knowledge	of	the	pathogenesis	of	the	disease	which	allows	its	earlier	diagnosis	the	rising	ethnic	and	racial	diversity	of	the	world	population	the	use	of	the	2019	EULAR	ACR	criteria	that	allows	classifying	patients	earlier	and	improvements	in	survival	over	the	last	decades	which	results	in	an	increase	in	the	prevalent	cases	of	SLE	In	this	article	we	will	also	review	the	genetic	environmental	and	lifestyle	factors	that	are	reported	to	increase	the	risk	of	developing	SLE	and	how	preventive	strategies	through	a	clinical	care	pathway	may	prevent	or	delay	the	development	of	SLE	and	improve	these	patients	outcomes
SLE	is	an	autoimmune	disease	characterised	by	persistent	inflammation	and	autoantibody	production	Genetic	predisposition	and	environmental	factors	such	as	a	high-fat	diet	HFD	may	contribute	to	lupus	development	However	the	immune	cell	profile	and	gender	difference	in	response	to	HFD	in	lupus	have	not	been	reported	Here	we	investigated	the	impact	of	HFD	on	lupus	pathogenesis	and	autoimmunity	using	lupus-prone	mice
Systemic	lupus	erythematosus	SLE	is	an	autoimmune	disease	that	has	diverse	clinical	manifestations	ranging	from	restricted	cutaneous	involvement	to	life-threatening	systemic	organ	involvement	The	heterogeneity	of	pathomechanisms	that	lead	to	SLE	contributes	to	between-patient	variation	in	clinical	phenotype	and	treatment	response	Ongoing	efforts	to	dissect	cellular	and	molecular	heterogeneity	in	SLE	could	facilitate	the	future	development	of	stratified	treatment	recommendations	and	precision	medicine	which	is	a	considerable	challenge	for	SLE	In	particular	some	genes	involved	in	the	clinical	heterogeneity	of	SLE	and	some	phenotype-related	loci	STAT4	IRF5	PDGF	genes	HAS2	ITGAM	and	SLC5A11	have	an	association	with	clinical	features	of	the	disease	An	important	part	is	also	played	by	epigenetic	varation	in	DNA	methylation	histone	modifications	and	microRNAs	that	influences	gene	expression	and	affects	cell	function	without	modifying	the	genome	sequence	Immune	profiling	can	help	to	identify	an	individual	s	specific	response	to	a	therapy	and	can	potentially	predict	outcomes	using	techniques	such	as	flow	cytometry	mass	cytometry	transcriptomics	microarray	analysis	and	single-cell	RNA	sequencing	Furthermore	the	identification	of	novel	serum	and	urinary	biomarkers	would	enable	the	stratification	of	patients	according	to	predictions	of	long-term	outcomes	and	assessments	of	potential	response	to	therapy

Systemic	lupus	erythematosus	SLE	is	a	disorder	with	a	complex	immunopathogenesis	It	is	well	known	that	the	disease	begins	with	immunological	alterations	and	autoantibody	appearance	in	the	serum	years	before	clinical	onset	As	SLE	has	a	strong	tendency	to	familial	aggregation	first-degree	relatives	FDRs	constitute	a	group	at	elevated	risk	The	current	understanding	is	that	external	risk	factors	trigger	underlying	immune	dysregulations	leading	to	overt	disease	in	those	with	elevated	genetic	risk
Systemic	lupus	erythematosus	SLE	is	an	autoimmune	disease	causing	significant	morbidity	and	mortality	despite	important	improvements	in	its	management	in	the	last	decades	The	objective	of	this	work	is	to	investigate	the	role	of	IFN-	in	the	pathogenesis	of	childhood-onset	systemic	lupus	erythematosus	cSLE	evaluating	the	crosstalk	between	IFN-	and	IFN-	and	the	expression	of	T-bet	a	transcription	factor	induced	by	IFN-	in	B	cells	of	patients	with	cSLE	Expression	levels	of	both	IFN-	and	IFN-	-induced	genes	were	upregulated	in	patients	with	cSLE	We	found	increased	serum	levels	of	CXCL9	and	CXCL10	in	patients	with	cSLE	Type	I	IFN	score	decreased	with	initiation	of	immunosuppressive	treatment	conversely	type	II	IFN	score	and	levels	of	CXCL9	were	not	significantly	affected	by	immunosuppressive	treatment	Type	II	IFN	score	and	CXCL9	were	significantly	higher	in	patients	with	lupus	nephritis	We	observed	the	expansion	of	a	population	of	na	ve	B	cells	expressing	T-bet	in	a	cluster	of	patients	with	cSLE	IFN-	but	not	IFN-	induced	the	expression	of	T-bet	in	B	cells	Our	data	suggest	that	IFN-	is	hyperactive	in	cSLE	especially	in	patients	with	lupus	nephritis	and	it	is	not	modulated	by	therapy	Our	data	reinforce	the	potential	of	IFN-	as	a	therapeutic	target	in	SLE

Patients	with	systemic	lupus	erythematosus	SLE	complicated	with	cryptococcal	meningitis	CM	are	easy	to	be	misdiagnosed	as	neuropsychiatric	lupus	or	tuberculous	meningitis	due	to	the	lack	of	specificity	of	clinical	symptoms	which	may	delay	treatment	Through	this	case	we	considered	early	improvement	of	India	ink	stain	of	cerebrospinal	fluid	CSF	and	metagenomic	next	generation	sequences	to	determine	whether	there	is	microbial	infection	and	gave	the	idea	of	empirical	anti-infection	therapy	so	as	to	make	early	diagnosis	and	slow	down	the	progression	of	the	disease
Neuropsychiatric	involvement	is	one	of	the	major	concerns	in	systemic	lupus	erythematosus	SLE	The	therapeutic	effect	of	intrathecal	treatment	of	methotrexate	and	dexamethasone	has	been	investigated	in	some	exploratory	studies	but	its	influence	on	the	long-term	prognosis	of	neuropsychiatric	SLE	NPSLE	remains	unknown
Lupus	nephritis	LN	is	one	of	the	most	severe	complications	of	systemic	lupus	erythematosus	SLE	However	the	current	management	of	LN	remains	unsatisfactory	due	to	sneaky	symptoms	during	early	stages	and	lack	of	reliable	predictors	of	disease	progression

Pneumocystis	jirovecii	is	an	opportunistic	fungal	organism	that	can	cause	fatal	pneumonia	in	immunocompromised	individuals	It	is	a	disease	associated	with	CD4	T	cell	depletion	or	high-dose	steroids	However	there	is	increasing	evidence	that	B	cell	dysfunction	may	also	play	a	role	in	this	illness
Systemic	lupus	erythematosus	SLE	is	a	multisystem	autoimmune	disorder	exhibiting	variable	disease	courses	and	multiple	clinical	manifestations	SLE	s	aetiology	remains	unclear	however	different	environmental	e	g	ultraviolet	light	infections	drugs	etc	genetic	and	hormonal	factors	are	potentially	involved	A	positive	family	history	and	history	of	having	other	autoimmune	illnesses	are	considered	high-risk	factors	for	SLE	nevertheless	most	SLE	cases	are	scattered	The	2019	European	League	Against	Rheumatism	American	College	of	Rheumatology	classification	criteria	for	SLE	include	at	least	one	positive	antinuclear	antibody	test	as	a	mandatory	entry	criterion	followed	by	additive	weighted	standards	grouped	in	seven	clinical	constitutional	haematological	neuropsychiatric	serosal	musculoskeletal	renal	and	mucocutaneous	and	three	immunological	antiphospholipid	antibodies	complement	proteins	and	SLE-specific	antibodies	domains	weighted	from	2	to	10	with	patients	accumulating	10	points	being	diagnosed	with	SLE	Herein	we	report	a	case	of	neuropsychiatric	lupus	a	rare	and	severe	form	of	SLE
The	use	of	hyaluronic	acid	HA	-based	aesthetic	therapies	is	growing	steadily	and	according	to	the	International	Society	of	Aesthetic	Plastic	Surgery	more	than	4	3	million	aesthetic	procedures	using	HA	were	performed	in	2019	an	increase	of	15	7	than	2018	More	people	are	offering	these	types	of	services	often	without	proper	training	or	qualifications	Therefore	there	is	an	increasing	number	of	reports	in	the	literature	relating	to	possible	adverse	events	with	subsequent	therapeutic	problems	and	more	or	less	serious	consequences	for	patients	The	aim	of	this	research	is	to	carry	out	a	review	of	the	literature	in	order	to	evaluate	the	impact	of	hyaluronic	acid-based	fillers	in	patients	with	autoimmune	inflammatory	diseases	in	particular	scleroderma	and	Systemic	Lupus	Erythematosus	SLE	Although	HA	plays	a	central	role	in	the	inflammatory	process	the	use	of	HA-based	fillers	in	patients	with	autoimmune	inflammatory	diseases	is	still	controversial	HA	in	fact	in	inflamed	tissues	helps	to	propagate	the	inflammatory	response	and	injected	in	the	form	of	a	dermal	filler	could	potentially	promote	reactivation	of	the	underlying	disease	For	this	reason	many	specialists	do	not	perform	HA-based	aesthetic	treatments	in	patients	with	scleroderma	or	SLE	However	recent	scientific	evidence	suggests	that	the	use	of	HA-based	fillers	in	patients	with	scleroderma	can	lead	to	improvement	of	skin	lesions	with	satisfactory	results	In	the	literature	there	are	no	clinical	studies	that	contraindicate	the	administration	of	HA-based	dermal	fillers	in	patients	with	inflammatory	disease

Patients	with	systemic	lupus	erythematosus	SLE	often	develop	multi-organ	damages	including	heart	and	kidney	complications	We	sought	to	better	define	the	underlying	mechanisms	with	a	focus	on	the	chemokine	receptor	CX3CR1
Undifferentiated	connective	tissue	disease	UCTD	is	characterized	by	the	presence	of	clinical	symptoms	of	a	systemic	autoimmune	disease	in	addition	to	laboratory	evidence	of	autoimmunity	with	the	patients	not	fulfilling	any	of	the	widely	used	classification	criteria	for	classic	autoimmune	diseases	The	presence	of	UCTD	as	a	separate	entity	versus	an	early	stage	of	such	diseases	as	systemic	lupus	erythematosus	SLE	or	scleroderma	has	long	been	debated	Given	the	uncertainty	regarding	this	condition	we	performed	a	systematic	review	on	the	topic

Maternal	systemic	lupus	erythematosus	SLE	is	at	greater	risk	of	pregnancy	complications	and	is	associated	with	increased	risk	of	preterm	delivery	However	hardly	any	study	has	looked	at	the	influence	of	SLE	on	the	outcomes	of	preterm	infants	This	study	aimed	to	explore	the	influence	of	SLE	on	the	outcomes	of	preterm	infants
Childhood-onset	systemic	lupus	erythematosus	cSLE	is	an	autoimmune	disease	that	results	in	significant	damage	and	often	needs	more	aggressive	treatment	Compared	to	adult-onset	SLE	cSLE	has	a	stronger	genetic	background	and	more	prevalent	elevated	type	I	Interferon	expression	The	management	of	cSLE	is	more	challenging	because	the	disease	itself	and	treatment	can	affect	physical	psychological	and	emotional	growth	and	development	High	dose	oral	glucocorticoid	GC	has	become	the	rule	for	treating	moderate	to	severe	cSLE	activity	However	GC-related	side	effects	and	potential	toxicities	are	problems	that	cannot	be	ignored	Recent	studies	have	suggested	that	GC	pulse	therapy	can	achieve	disease	remission	rapidly	and	reduce	GC-related	side	effects	with	a	reduction	in	oral	prednisone	doses	This	article	reviews	characteristics	including	pathogenesis	and	manifestations	of	cSLE	and	summarized	the	existing	evidence	on	GC	therapy	especially	on	GC	pulse	therapy	in	cSLE	followed	by	our	proposal	for	GC	therapy	according	to	the	clinical	effects	and	pathogenesis
Low-dose	interleukin-2	IL-2	regulates	the	homeostasis	of	CD4	T	cells	by	modulating	the	proportions	of	effector	and	regulatory	T	cells	thus	reducing	disease	activity	in	patients	with	systemic	lupus	erythematosus	SLE	However	to	date	no	research	has	been	carried	out	on	the	efficacy	of	low-dose	IL-2	for	treating	autoimmune	thyroid	disease	AITD	The	aim	of	this	study	was	to	observe	the	effects	of	IL-2	on	AITD	patients	with	concurrent	SLE	and	explore	potential	mechanism	of	action
This	study	investigated	the	relationship	between	circulating	interleukin-33	IL-33	levels	and	systemic	lupus	erythematosus	SLE	along	with	polymorphisms	in	the	IL-33	gene	and	SLE	susceptibility
Pneumocystis	jirovecii	is	an	opportunistic	fungal	organism	that	can	cause	fatal	pneumonia	in	immunocompromised	individuals	It	is	a	disease	associated	with	CD4	T	cell	depletion	or	high-dose	steroids	However	there	is	increasing	evidence	that	B	cell	dysfunction	may	also	play	a	role	in	this	illness
Systemic	lupus	erythematosus	SLE	is	a	disorder	with	a	complex	immunopathogenesis	It	is	well	known	that	the	disease	begins	with	immunological	alterations	and	autoantibody	appearance	in	the	serum	years	before	clinical	onset	As	SLE	has	a	strong	tendency	to	familial	aggregation	first-degree	relatives	FDRs	constitute	a	group	at	elevated	risk	The	current	understanding	is	that	external	risk	factors	trigger	underlying	immune	dysregulations	leading	to	overt	disease	in	those	with	elevated	genetic	risk
