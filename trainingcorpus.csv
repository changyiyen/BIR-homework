Bisphenol A BPA common environmental endocrine disruptor mimic effect estrogen The immunotoxicity BPA attracted widespread attention recent years However effects mechanism BPA autoimmune disease rarely reported Systemic lupus erythematosus SLE a typical autoimmune disease its etiology mechanism complex unclear Currently inflammation production autoantibodies considered important pathological mechanisms SLE estrogen contributes occurrence development SLE Therefore order explore BPA exposure affect development SLE its possible mechanism used MRL lpr lupus-prone mice C57 BL6 female mice exposed 0 1 0 2 g mL BPA 6 weeks We discovered BPA exposure increased concentration serum anti-dsDNA antibody IL-17 the level ROR protein the transcription factor Th17 cells Moreover higher expression p-PI3K p-AKT p-mTOR ULK Rubicon P62 Becline1 LC3 protein spleen tissue BPA exposed MRL lpr mice compared the control However were significant changes the expression IL-17 ROR or mTOR C57 mice exposed BPA the dose Our study implied BPA exposure induced the development SLE might be related the up-regulation PI3K AKT mTOR signaling pathway abnormal autophagy Our study indicated lupus mice were more susceptible BPA provided a new insight the mechanism which BPA exacerbated SLE Therefore study suggested autoimmune patients susceptible population be considered setting thresholds environmental BPA exposure

The prevention chronic damage especially early disease phases remains unmet management Systemic Lupus Erythematous SLE patients despite application so-called treat-to-target strategy The high proportion SLE patients developing chronic damage suggests multifactorial aetiology Thus disease activity factors contribute development damage The revision data published far underlines next disease activity possible identify factors playing relevant role damage development progression In summary presence antiphospholipid antibodies drugs treat SLE patients particular glucocorticoids is strongly associated SLE-related damage Furthermore recent data suggests possible role genetic background determining development specific organ damage particular renal neurological Nonetheless demographic factors as age sex disease duration exert role with presence comorbidities The contribution different factors in determining damage development suggests need new outcomes to assess a comprehensive disease control including only assessment disease activity also the evaluation chronic damage development
