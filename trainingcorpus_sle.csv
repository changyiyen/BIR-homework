In systemic lupus erythematosus SLE relevance non-hematopoietic sources type I interferon human autoimmunity recently recognized Particularly type I interferon production precedes autoimmunity early skin lesions related SLE However relevance intrarenal type I interferon expression shown lupus nephritis From transcriptome array datasets median-centered log2 mRNA expression levels IFN IFNA1 IFNA2 IFNA4 IFNA5 IFNA6 IFNA7 IFNA8 IFNA10 IFNA13 IFNA14 IFNA16 IFNA17 IFNA21 IFN IFNW1 IFN IFNB1 lupus nephritis extracted specifically microdissected tubulointerstitial 32 glomerular compartments 32 We found association proteinuria tubulointerstitial expression type I interferon IFNA5 p 0 0142 all were not significantly associated By contrast such correlation observed proteinuria any type I interferon expression glomerular compartment lupus nephritis Interestingly was difference female male patients p 0 8237 no association type I interferon IFNA5 expression kidney function lupus nephritis progression Finally identified distinct molecular signatures involved transcriptional regulation GLI protein-regulated transcription IRF7 activation HSF1-dependent transactivation receptor signaling BMP signaling GPCR ligand binding association tubulointerstitial expression type I interferon IFNA5 kidney In summary transcriptome array-based approach links proteinuria the tubulointerstitial expression type I interferon IFNA5 lupus nephritis Because type I interferon receptor subunit I antagonism recently investigated active SLE the current study emphasizes the role type I interferons lupus nephritis might be relevance mechanistic studies
Systemic lupus erythematosus-related transverse myelitis SLE-TM a rare serious complication SLE may result significant morbidity Its incidence estimated 0 5 1 all SLE patients may presenting feature 30 -60 these patients Unfortunately due lack high-quality studies data condition remains limited Its pathogenesis remains largely unknown clinical presentation variable There still set guidelines diagnosis management monitoring the role autoantibodies remains controversial In this review aim summarize the available data the epidemiology pathogenesis clinical features management prognosis this rare disease
